# Introduction

This project contains code to convert PDD/Profile data from Varian's TrueBeam Representative Data (downloaded from www.myvarian.com) to IBA's RFA300 format.  The converted files can be found in the rfa_W2CAD folder.  The RFA300 files can be directly imported into IBA's myQA Accept software for QA use.  The output factors were not supported in this project.
